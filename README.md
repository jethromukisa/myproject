FINAL PROJECT: APPOINTMENTS
For my final project,I developed a web program,"Appointments" which is to be used for scheduling appointments and also
shows the user the appointments they have scheduled before.

HOW IT WORKS
The user has an account in which they log into, or if not create an account, after which they are directed to the dashboard which
shows the user the appointments they have scheduled before both those that have passed and those yet to come. If the user wants
to make a new appointment they click on "Schedule" where they can select a date of their choice that is between the next day or
three months after the present day on which they are logged in.The user is then redirected to the dashboard where he/she will see
the date which they picked on the list containing the appointment dates.
Incase the user has forgotten the password to their account they are also free to vhange their password by following the link which
appears on the login page,however the user must remember the name which they used to log in lest it will not work.
